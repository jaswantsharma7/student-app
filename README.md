# Student App

A full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application for managing student records. Supports full CRUD — create, read, update, and delete — through a clean, interactive interface. The entire stack is deployed and live.

## Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- A MongoDB connection string (local or [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas))

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaswantsharma7/student-app.git
cd student-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
```

### 4. Run the Backend Server

```bash
node server.js
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 5. Run the React Frontend

In a separate terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/students` | Fetch all student records |
| `POST` | `/students` | Add a new student |
| `PUT` | `/students/:id` | Update an existing student by ID |
| `DELETE` | `/students/:id` | Delete a student by ID |

---

## Deployment

- The **React frontend** is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as a static site.
- The **Express backend** (`server.js`) is deployed on [Render](https://render.com/) as a web service.
- **MongoDB Atlas** is used as the cloud database.

To deploy your own fork:
1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Connect it to Vercel for the frontend.
3. Connect it to Render for the backend.
4. Add `MONGODB_URI` as an environment variable in both Render and Vercel project settings.
